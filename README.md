# Resume

## Project Overview
Resume is an interactive mobile version of my resume. It showcases my name, job title, picture, A little bit about yourself, social media links and my skills.
-It supports dark mode and 4 languages which are Arabic, French, Spanish and Yoruba.
-It adapts its layout to landscape and portrait orientations accordingly.

## Libraries used and why i used them
I did not import a new library, i used the existing ones which are:
- Jetpack Compose - It is faster, easier to use and requires less code.
- Material Design - I majorly used for theming, styling, typography.
- Android KTX - Used to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code

## Challenges and how i solved them
- Design: I am not so good with design so it took me a while to figure out what to do, i had to check designs on Dribbble.
- Github: I have never used SSH key to push my code to Github, i have only used username and email, i checked the github documentation and read an article on medium in other to learn how to do it.
